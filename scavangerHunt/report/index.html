    <h3>Issues Found</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Alternate text missing for several images and links</li>
      <li>Very low contrast</li>
      <li>Skipped heading levels</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
    <p>The design of the website is well done to maintain visibility to an audience who can only see a limited range of color. Most of the errors from the WAVE test are missing or incorrect alternate text, which should be necessary if any users have additional visual disabilities and require a screen reader.</p>
